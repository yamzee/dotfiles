/*
/  Hey! This is going to be my dotfiles repo. Mostly for keeping track of various dotfiles (and 
/  makefiles for suckless and such) I keep over various installations. Hopefully I keep it nice and clean,
/  but, it's not been like that so far. 
/  
/  Right now: this will mostly be for backing up my (often changing) dotfiles so that I can keep 
/  settings pretty uniform for my Desktop and Laptop computers, as I'm using near identical setups in 
/  both.
/  
/  Things that are unique to a distro will be kept 
/  in its own folder, and shared configuration files or makefiles will be in the root dotfiles folder.
/
/  Important thing to note: a lot of the configs will be set up for MY INSTALLATION specifically. 
/  Just be careful and make sure you edit out what won't work, and edit in what will. 
/
/  Also, I have a notes folder. If anything's of use: cool! It's mostly for my forgetful brain.
/  
/  If you find anything useful, cheers. Thanks for stopping on by.
