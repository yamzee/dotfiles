/*
/  Hey! This is going to be my dotfiles repo. Mostly for keeping track of various dotfiles (and 
/  makefiles) I keep over various installations. Hopefully I keep it nice and clean, but, only 
/  time will tell.
/  
/  Right now: this will mostly be for backing up my (often changing) dotfiles so that I can keep 
/  settings pretty uniform for my Desktop and Laptop computers, as I'm using near identical setups in 
/  both.
/  
/  Things that are unique to a distro (right now, I'm only on one, so I just have one) will be kept 
/  in its own folder, and shared configuration files or makefiles will be in the root dotfiles folder.
/  
/  If you find anything useful, cheers. Thanks for stopping on by.
