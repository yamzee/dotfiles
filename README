This is still going to be my dotfiles repo (seldom updated), I just thought I'd update
the README with something more important.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW, BEFORE YOU MESS WITH ANY OF MY DOTFILES:
Make sure your Pango vers. is <1.44. For some reason, the lovely folk at Gnome/GTK
have decided to cut support for Bitmap fonts in the latest 1.44.X versions. If you want
to use any of my dotfiles, and don't want compatability issues, either change the font
or downgrade and keep Pango from updating. Again, this is super important, unless of 
course, you have a quadrillion dpi monitor and can use anti-aliased faux-bitmap fonts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dotfiles will be split by OS, and there might be some messiness since I use files from
a few. I think I still use the ranger config from ArchLabs, but I might've updated and
moved it to the Arch folder.
If for some reason, a dotfile is broken and I don't know about it, you can leave an 
issue, or whatever. I don't know how GH works. Usually I'll know, and work on it before
even uploading it here.
