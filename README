/* Hey! This is going to be my dotfiles repo. Mostly for keeping track of various dotfiles I keep 
/  over various installations. Hopefully I keep it nice and clean, but, only time will tell.
/  
/  Right now: this will mostly be for backing up my (hardly changed) dotfiles so that I can keep 
/  settings pretty uniform for my Desktop and Laptop computers, as I'm using near identical setups in 
/  both.
/  
/  If you find anything useful, amazing! But again, this is mostly for myself. Thanks for stopping
/  on by, though.
